# Docker Networking for Postgres and Kestra

## Removing Network from `postgres-db` and `pgadmin`

If you remove the custom network configuration from your **postgres-db** and **pgadmin** Compose file, those containers will be attached to the default network that Docker Compose creates for the project. This has several implications when another service, like **Kestra**, needs to connect to the **postgres-zoomcamp** database.

### 1. Default Network Isolation  

#### **Within the Same Compose File**
- If all services (**Kestra**, **postgres-db**, and **pgadmin**) are defined in the same `docker-compose.yml` file and you remove custom network definitions, they will all be on the same **default network**.
- In this case, containers can still communicate using their service names. Your `pluginDefaults` configuration for Kestra should be:

  ```yaml
  pluginDefaults:
    - type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql
      values:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://postgres-db:5432/postgres-zoomcamp
        username: kestra
        password: k3str4

Across Different Compose Files
If Kestra is defined in a separate docker-compose.yml file from postgres-db and pgadmin, they will be attached to different networks by default.
In this case, Kestra will not be able to resolve postgres-db as the hostname unless they share a network.
2. Solutions to Ensure Connectivity
Option 1: Use the Same Network
To allow communication between Kestra and postgres-db, they must be on the same network. You can achieve this by:

Creating a shared external network:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker network create my_shared_network
Updating both Compose files to use this network:

In postgres-db's docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
networks:
  my_shared_network:
    external: true
In Kestra's docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
networks:
  my_shared_network:
    external: true
Option 2: Use host.docker.internal
If you prefer not to modify the networks, you can use host.docker.internal to access the Postgres database from Kestra:

yaml
Copy
Edit
pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql
    values:
      url: jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/postgres-zoomcamp
      username: kestra
      password: k3str4
Note: host.docker.internal is supported on Mac and Windows but may require additional setup on Linux.

3. Summary

| Scenario    | Solution |
| -------- | ------- |
| All services in the same Compose file |	No changes needed; use postgres-db as the hostname.    |
| Kestra in a separate Compose file | Attach both services to the same external network or use host.docker.internal. |

All services in the same Compose file	No changes needed; use postgres-db as the hostname.
Kestra in a separate Compose file	Attach both services to the same external network or use host.docker.internal.
Choose the approach that best fits your setup. If you are running everything in a single Compose file, removing the custom network is fine. Otherwise, you must ensure connectivity using one of the above methods.

# Docker Compose: Kestra and PostgreSQL Setup Notes

## Issue Identified
Running multiple instances of PostgreSQL and Kestra containers caused connection conflicts:
- Multiple PostgreSQL instances:
  - `postgres-db` (port 5432)
  - `02-kestra-postgres-1` (no exposed port)
- Multiple Kestra instances:
  - `02-kestra-kestra-1`

## Solution Steps

1. **Clean up existing containers**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker rm -f 02-kestra-postgres-1 02-kestra-kestra-1
```

2. **Create unified docker-compose.yml**
- Combined Kestra and PostgreSQL configurations
- Added proper network configuration
- Set explicit container names
- Configured shared volumes

3. **Key Configuration Components**
```yaml
# Network setup
networks:
  pg-network2:
    external: true

# Volume configuration
volumes:
  postgres-data:
    driver: local
  kestra-data:
    driver: local

# Service configuration highlights
services:
  postgres:
    container_name: postgres-db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    
  kestra:
    container_name: kestra
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
```

## Verification Steps
1. Check running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```

2. Verify database connection:
```bash
pgcli -h localhost -U kestra -d kestra
```

3. Access services:
- Kestra UI: http://localhost:8080
- PgAdmin: http://localhost:8090
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

## Important Notes
- Always use explicit container names to avoid conflicts
- Ensure proper network configuration for container communication
- Use healthchecks for dependent services
- Configure volumes for data persistence
